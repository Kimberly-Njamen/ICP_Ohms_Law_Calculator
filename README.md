# Ohm’s Law Resistance Calculator (ICP Mini Project)

Date: December 2023  
Language/Environment: Processing (Java-based)

## Overview
This project is a GUI-based Ohm’s Law calculator developed as part of my
Interactive Computer Programming module in first year.

Users input voltage and current values via an on-screen keypad, and the
application calculates resistance using Ohm’s Law (V = I × R).

## Features
- Custom GUI built using Processing
- Interactive keypad with mouse input
- Real-time calculation and display of voltage, current, and resistance
- Event-driven logic using mousePressed()
- Use of arrays, loops, functions, and conditional statements

## Learning Outcomes Demonstrated
- GUI design and user interaction
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Arrays and functions
- Basic numerical computation
- Event-driven programming

## Notes
This was my first major programming project at university.
The code is intentionally left close to its original form to reflect my
learning progression. More recent repositories show cleaner structure,
modularity, and more advanced design patterns.

## Future Improvements (Optional)
- Refactor repetitive conditionals into reusable functions
- Improve separation of UI and logic
- Add input validation and error handling
